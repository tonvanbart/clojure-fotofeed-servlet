### Learning clojure

This is a small project trying to build a (clojure) servlet that reads a Picasa RSS feed and parses it to html.
Works when I run it in Jetty (`mvn jetty:run`) it will work, however this will not work on Google App Engine as I originally intended.
Shared here for my own convenience and to help out anybody trying to look for a simple example.

**Note:** I am still a Clojure beginner, so there's no guarantee (from me) that this code is "the right way to do it".
It does work, however.  :)
